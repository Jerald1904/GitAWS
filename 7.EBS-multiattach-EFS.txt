EFS-ELASTIC FILE SYSTEM
-----------------------------------

EBS multi attach and EFS
------------------------

Drawbacks of EBS:
	1. EBS volume and the running instance should be in the same AZ.
	2. Single EBS can't be attached to multiple EC2 machines.

To overcome the above drawbacks:
	1. To enable multi attach feature we should opt for 
		a. Provisioned IOPs SSD
		b. We are forced to choose nitro based EC2 instances to use multi attached EBS.
	2. EBS is a AZ specific service.

Transition into Infrequent Access(IA):
	If the data is untouched for 30 days that data will be moved to Infrequent Access storage.
	Once we try to access the data which got moved to (IA) during the first access that specific data will be moved to standard storage automatically.

Steps to create an EFS:
------------------------
	1. Seach for EFS in the search bar and click on Create File system.
	2. Click on customize.
	3. You will be redirected to fill in file system settings.
	4. Provide any name.
	5. Select "Regional" under File system type.
	6. Enable "Automatic backup"
	7. Leave the "lifecycle management" settings and "encryption" as it is (go through the defenition under each type). Select "Transition into Archive" to "None" if you are getting an error.
	8. Under performance settings select "Bursting".
	9. Tags are optional, hit on next.
       10. Under network settings leave the VPC and in mount target replace ur own sg
       security group--> vpc feature-->edit the inbound rule nfs anywhere ipv4
       11. Hit on next and leave the "File system policy" as it is optional.
       12. Hit on next and "Review and create" in the next page.

Steps to attach EFS with multiple EC2 instances:
------------------------------------------------
	1. Please create 2 EC2 instances at first.
	2. Click on the EFS we created above.
	3. Click on attach.
	4. Click on "Mount via DNS" or "Mount via IP".
	5. Login to both the instances we created and run the below commands.

	sudo su --> Switch user as root user
	yum update -y --> update the current packages
	yum install -y nfs-utils --> to install nfs
	mkdir efs --> creating a directory on both the servers(you can give any name)

	6. After you execute the above commands on both the instances mount the directory we created to EFS. (in our case it is "efs")
	7. To mount the filesystem go to EFS we created and look for the "Attach" option, copy the command which says "Using the NFS client". Below is an example of the command.

	sudo mount -t nfs4 -o nfsvers=4.1,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,hard,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport fs-0f8f5eafeda8d5522.efs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:/ efs

	8. Now login to any of the EC2 instances and try to create a file using "touch" command. Then login to the other instance and verify whether you are able to access the same file.


300 MBPs --> Bandwidth
250 MBPs --> Throughput

Bandwidth - The maximum amount of data which can be transferred/downloaded from one system to another is called as Bandwidth.

Throughput - The amount of data which is transferred/downloaded at the moment in a given point of time. (Data downloaded/uploaded per second)


linux commands
----------------------------
mkdir efs-->make directory
cd efs---->change directory
touch file1.txt--> create a file.
vi file1.txt-->editor tool to edit a file
i
enter content
esc
shift ; wq--->:wq
cat file1.txt-->to read a file
